abstract={This paper outlines methods to detect key anchor points in 3D face scanner data. These anchor points can be used to estimate the pose and then match the test image to a 3D face model. We present two algorithms for detecting face anchor points in the context of face verification; One for frontal images and one for arbitrary pose. We achieve 99 success in finding anchor points in frontal images and 86 success in scans with large variations in pose and changes in expression. These results demonstrate the challenges in 3D face recognition under arbitrary pose and expression. We are currently working on robust fitting algorithms to localize more precisely the anchor points for arbitrary pose images.}

abstract={This paper introduces Evolutionary Putsuit (EP) as a novel approach for 3D facial landmark localization. Leveraging the global optimization ability of genetic algorithm (GA), an innovative framework for detecting local features, like nose tips and eye-corners, on 3D face data is proposed. Facial landmarks are localized by combining responses of several weak classifiers as basic building blocks. A genetic algorithm is employed for searching the optimal way to combine these building blocks, in order to construct a classifier with high detection accuracy. This GA-based facial landmark detection method is evaluated on the FRGC v1 database; it shows promising results that the GA searching process is able to produce an effective feature classifier from a relatively small training set, achieving a strong landmark localization ability.},
